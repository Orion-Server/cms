## 🌀 Introduction

**OrionCMS** (Content Management System) is a system that promotes **usability** and **manageability** for your hotel. Orion's purpose is to make your experience and that of your players the best experience possible.

**Built with the most modern technologies for websites**, OrionCMS will provide a lot of security and modernity for your hotel, in addition to containing exclusive systems that will make a difference in your day-to-day.

Touching on the subject of differences, the Orion dashboard will surely surprise you. Fully responsive, elegant, secure, and real-time. Most of the updates made to the panel will be reflected in the game, **and that's really surreal**.

The demo site can be accessed [here](https://orionprojects.net/).
