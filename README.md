## ⚠️ An important notice about Orion:

**Orion's development will pause**. After a year of development, I met all my expectations regarding the system and as much as I would like to bring more updates, it is currently not possible because things have changed, my priorities are different and now  > **I am stopping working with Habbo** <.

If you use Orion or are reading this intending to use Orion, **listen up: It's still a safe system to use, and you can use it without any problems**. The only difference is that there will no longer be new systems.

Help channels and general will remain open.

**OBS: Important updates (such as vulnerabilities) will continue to be updated!**
